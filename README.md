# Causal-explanations-for-RL

This framework generates causal explanations for Reinformcent learning agents using structural causal models.

- Reinforcements agents are trained using appropriate algorithms.

- Structural equations can be trained using 3 different regressors (linear, trees and neural).



### Installation

- requires Tensorflow 1.14 (only tested with this version).

- requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

- requires [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) 1.11 (only works with 1.11 version)
